Form is key, reduce the intensity if you cannot hold your form. Resistance during the Build Phase: The most strength gains are made during this phase. Progress intensity by adding resistance only if you are able to maintain correct form throughout. Sets should feel more challenging, however be cautious of negatively impacting your following workouts. Perform strength and conditioning once or twice each week. Avoid the ‘no pain, no gain’ thinking. Strength will compliment your training making you more powerful, less prone to injury and help you focus on range of movement required for all three disciplines. It should not inhibit your subsequent workouts.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For flexibility see the link below or choose stretches that work well for you.","0.666666666666667","","2022-08-30","Peak Phase: This phase allows you to focus on sport-specific training. This means decreasing the stress of your strength and conditioning training session by reducing intensity and volume. The time allowed for flexibility is increased, maintaining mobility and range of movement during this phase is key. Resistance during the Peak Phase: The resistance should reduce back to what you were lifting in the Base Phase. Stay focused on form. Perform strength and conditioning once each week for this phase. Avoid the ‘no pain, no gain’ thinking. Strength will compliment your training making you more powerful, less prone to injury and help you focus on range of movement required for all three disciplines. It should not inhibit your subsequent workouts.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concentrate on driving the thigh of your swing leg forward a little more forcefully than you normally do. The more forceful forward/upward movement of this leg will create a counterbalancing downward/backward action in your opposite leg as it comes into contact with the ground. (Think of the way your free arm moves in opposition to your throwing arm when you throw a ball hard.) Feel free to concentrate on driving only one thigh throughout a workout or, if you can manage it, to concentrate on driving both thighs. (The average stride rate being in excess of 150 per minute, it can be difficult to focus your attention properly on both legs when using this proprioceptive cue). This cue will help you refine the coordinated timing of movements between your two legs and enhance your stride stiffness.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When an exercise alternates right and left, the right PLUS left movement is 1 rep. 4. For unilateral exercises, perform reps on the right, then repeat on the left. Then move to next set. 5. Breathe out on exertion and maintain form throughout. 6. For flexibility see the link below or choose stretches that work well for you.","0.666666666666667","","2022-10-28","Peak Phase: This phase allows you to focus on sport-specific training. This means decreasing the stress of your strength and conditioning training session by reducing intensity and volume. The time allowed for flexibility is increased, maintaining mobility and range of movement during this phase is key. Resistance during the Peak Phase: The resistance should reduce back to what you were lifting in the Base Phase. Stay focused on form. Perform strength and conditioning once each week for this phase. Avoid the ‘no pain, no gain’ thinking. Strength will compliment your training making you more powerful, less prone to injury and help you focus on range of movement required for all three disciplines. It should not inhibit your subsequent workouts.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
