"Aerobic Endurance Ride","Bike","Ride mainly in Z2.","2.25","","2022-01-15","Phil’s Training Tip: Your ""cadence"" is the count of how many pedal revolutions you do per minute. Whereas, ""power output"" is a combination of your cadence AND how hard you pedal. Therefore, to increase your power output you would need to pedal faster in the same gear. Or pedal at the same cadence, but in a bigger gear. What's the Best Cadence? Research is unclear on the single ""best cadence"" to ride at. One study suggests that athletes subconsciously self-select the cadence that's most efficient at a given time. The best cadence for your needs can also depend on the type of cyclist you are, your aerobic fitness, physique, leg strength and exercise intensity. For example, your cadence might naturally be higher in a race, and lower during an easy training ride. What Cadence to Target? 85-90 rpm is ideal for many riders, but don't force yourself to ride at that cadence if it doesn't feel right. Try not to get too worried about your cadence - it may naturally change over time anyway. You're better off focusing on increasing your power output and reducing your aerodynamic drag.","65038.46875","192","416","1578.345","","2.27844262123108","7.92899990081787","","81","","148","163","","","0.661641387063147","98.43","2","23","112","0","0","","","","","","12","112","11","1","0","","","","","","",""
